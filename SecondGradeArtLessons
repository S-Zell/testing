**Corn-dinsky Project:**
In this project students worked on replicating Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract style in his Color Study. Squares with Concentric Circles in the grid of corn that they drew, in a celebration of Fall and the season of harvest.  


**Roll-a-Picasso Project:**
This project was a challenge for the kids!  Students rolled dice and chose from the given styles to create features of faces, in the cubist style of Pablo Picasso in his Ladies on the Banks of the Seine.  Each feature was put onto a separate piece of construction paper and glued to their pictures, creating something new, different and fun. 

**_Stopping by Woods on A Snowy Evening_ Project:**
We celebrated the winter season with this project.  We read Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, by Robert Frost, and looked at beautiful the snowy scenes in the book.  The kids then painted their own scenes, and splatter painted snow on top to emulate the illustrations by Susan Jeffers.

**Sekkyo’s _The Eagle_:**
Torn Paper Owl Project
In this project the students were inspired by Sekkyo’s The Eagle.  After examining The Eagle, Students learned a method for drawing owls using oil pastels, then tore paper and glued it onto their pictures in emulation of the texture of feathers.

 
**Stopping by Woods on A Snowy Evening**
_By Robert Frost_
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village, though; 
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
 


**Color-Wheel Creations:**
In this lesson Students learned about Primary Colors, Secondary Colors, and the Color Wheel.  The kids painted the primary colors onto their color wheels, then mixed them and applied to the wheel.  Students were then challenged to create a picture around their color wheel.


**Michelangelo Lesson**
This lesson was a stretch – literally!  The kids learned about Michelangelo’s painting of the Sistine Chapel.  We examined some of the images from the Sistine Chapel, particularly Michelangelo’s self-portrait.  Then, the kids drew a self-portrait on paper – taped to the underside of their desks!  This was a fun lesson learning about the great lengths that artists take in creating their works.
